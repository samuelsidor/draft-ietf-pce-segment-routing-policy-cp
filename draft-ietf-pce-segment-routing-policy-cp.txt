 Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for
              Segment Routing (SR) Policy Candidate Paths
              draft-ietf-pce-segment-routing-policy-cp-21

Abstract

   Segment Routing (SR) allows a node to steer a packet flow along any
   path.  SR Policy is an ordered list of segments (i.e., instructions)
   that represent a source-routed policy.  Packet flows are steered into
   an SR Policy on a node where it is instantiated called a headend
   node.  An SR Policy is made of one or more candidate paths.

   This document specifies the Path Computation Element Communication
   Protocol (PCEP) extension to signal candidate paths of the SR Policy.
   Additionally, this document updates RFC 8231 to allow stateful bring
   up of an SR Label Switched Path (LSP), without using the path
   computation request and reply messages.  This document is applicable
   to both Segment Routing over MPLS (SR-MPLS) and Segment Routing over
   IPv6 (SRv6).

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing Policy Architecture [RFC9256] details the concepts of
   SR Policy and approaches to steering traffic into an SR Policy.

   PCEP Extensions for Segment Routing [RFC8664] specifies extensions to
   the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) that allow a stateful
   PCE to compute and initiate Traffic Engineering (TE) paths, as well
   as a PCC to request a path subject to certain constraint(s) and
   optimization criteria in SR networks.  Although PCEP extensions
   introduced in [RFC8664] were originally used to create SR-TE tunnels,
   these are not SR Policies and lack many important features and
   details.

   PCEP Extensions for Establishing Relationships Between Sets of PCEP
   LSPs [RFC8697] introduces a generic mechanism to create a grouping of
   LSPs which is called an Association.

   This document extends [RFC8664] to support signaling SR Policy
   Candidate Paths as PCEP LSPs and to signal Candidate Path membership
   in an SR Policy by means of the Association mechanism.  The PCEP
   Association corresponds to the SR Policy and the PCEP LSP corresponds
   to the Candidate Path.  The unit of signaling in PCEP is the LSP,
   thus all the information is carried at the Candidate Path level.

   This document updates Section 5.8.2 of [RFC8231], making the PCReq
   message optional for LSPs set up using Path Setup Type 1 (Segment
   Routing) described in [RFC8664] and 3 (SRv6) described in [RFC9603],
   allowing a PCC to delegate such LSP by sending a PCRpt without the
   preliminary PCReq and PCRep messages, with the aim of reducing the
   PCEP message exchanges and simplifying implementation.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all

3.  Overview

   The SR Policy is represented by a new type of PCEP Association,
   called the SR Policy Association.  The SR Candidate Paths of an SR
   Policy are the PCEP LSPs within the same SRPA.  The subject of
   encoding multiple Segment Lists within an SR Policy Candidate Path is
   described in [I-D.ietf-pce-multipath].

   The SRPA carries three pieces of information: SR Policy Identifier,
   SR Policy Candidate Path Identifier, and SR Policy Candidate Path
   Attribute(s).

   This document also specifies some additional information that is not
   encoded as part of SRPA: Computation Priority, Explicit Null Label
   Policy and Drop-upon-invalid behavior.

   This document does not propose any extension for the use of BSID with
   SR Policy; the existing behavior is documented in [RFC9604].

3.1.  SR Policy Identifier

   SR Policy Identifier uniquely identifies the SR Policy [RFC9256]
   within the network.  SR Policy Identifier MUST be the same for all SR
   Policy Candidate Paths in the same SRPA.  SR Policy Identifier MUST
   be constant for a given SR Policy Candidate Path for the lifetime of
   the PCEP session.  SR Policy Identifier MUST be different for
   different SRPAs.  If the identifier is inconsistent among Candidate
   Paths, changes during the lifetime of the PCEP session, or is not
   unique across different SRPAs, the PCEP speaker MUST send a PCErr
   message with Error-Type = 26 "Association Error" and Error Value = 20
   "SR Policy Identifier Mismatch".  SR Policy Identifier consist of:

   *  Headend router where the SR Policy originates.

   *  Color of SR Policy ([RFC9256] Section 2.1).

   *  Endpoint of SR Policy ([RFC9256] Section 2.1).

3.2.  SR Policy Candidate Path Identifier

   SR Policy Candidate Path Identifier uniquely identifies the SR Policy
   Candidate Path within the context of an SR Policy.  SR Policy
   Candidate Path Identifier MUST be constant for the lifetime of the
   PCEP session.  SR Policy Candidate Path Identifier MUST be different
   for distinct Candidate Paths within the same SRPA.  If an identifier
   changes during the lifetime of the PCEP session or is not unique
   among distinct Candidate Paths, the PCEP speaker MUST send a PCErr
   message with Error-Type = 26 "Association Error" and Error Value = 21
   "SR Policy Candidate Path Identifier Mismatch".  SR Policy Candidate
   Path Identifier consist of:

   *  Protocol Origin ([RFC9256] Section 2.3).

   *  Originator ([RFC9256] Section 2.4).

   *  Discriminator ([RFC9256] Section 2.5).

3.3.  SR Policy Candidate Path Attributes

   SR Policy Candidate Path Attributes carry optional, non-key
   information about the Candidate Path and MAY change during the
   lifetime of the LSP.  SR Policy Candidate Path Attributes consist of:

   *  Candidate Path preference.

   *  Candidate Path name.

Internet-Draft               PCEP SR Policy                February 2025


   *  SR Policy name.

4.  SR Policy Association

   As per [RFC8697], LSPs are associated with other LSPs with which they
   interact by adding them to a common association group.  As described
   in [RFC8697], the association group is uniquely identified by the
   combination of the following fields in the ASSOCIATION object:
   Association Type, Association ID, Association Source, and (if
   present) Global Association Source or Extended Association ID,
   referred to as Association Parameters.

   [RFC8697] specifies the ASSOCIATION Object with two Object-Types for
   IPv4 and IPv6 which includes the field "Association Type".  This
   document defines a new Association type (6) "SR Policy Association"
   for SRPA.

   [RFC8697] specifies the mechanism for the capability advertisement of
   the Association Types supported by a PCEP speaker by defining an
   ASSOC-Type-List TLV to be carried within an OPEN object.  This
   capability exchange for the SR Policy Association Types MUST be done
   before using the SRPA.  Thus, the PCEP speaker MUST include the SRPA
   Type (6) in the ASSOC-Type-List TLV and MUST receive the same from
   the PCEP peer before using SRPA.

   A given LSP MUST belong to at most one SRPA, since an SR Policy
   Candidate Path cannot belong to multiple SR Policies.  If a PCEP
   speaker receives a PCEP message requesting to join more than one SRPA
   for the same LSP, then the PCEP speaker MUST send a PCErr message
   with Error-Type = 26 "Association Error", Error-Value = 7 "Cannot
   join the association group".

4.1.  Association Parameters

   As per [RFC9256], an SR Policy is identified through the tuple
   <headend, color, endpoint>.  The headend is encoded in the
   'Association Source' field in the ASSOCIATION object.  The color and
   endpoint are encoded as part of the Extended Association ID TLV.

   The Association Parameters (see Section 2) consist of:

   *  Association Type: Part of the base ASSOCIATION object.  Set to 6
      "SR Policy Association".

   *  Association Source (IPv4/IPv6): Part of the base ASSOCIATION
      object.  Set to the headend value of the SR Policy, as defined in
      [RFC9256] Section 2.1.

Internet-Draft               PCEP SR Policy                February 2025


   *  Association ID (16-bit): Part of the base ASSOCIATION object.
      Always set to the numeric value "1".  This 16-bit field does not
      store meaningful data, because neither the Color nor the Endpoint
      can fit in it.

   *  Extended Association ID TLV: Mandatory TLV of the ASSOCIATION
      object.  Encodes the Color and Endpoint of the SR Policy.

                Figure 1: Extended Association ID TLV format

   Type: Extended Association ID TLV, type = 31 [RFC8697].

   Length: Either 8 or 20, depending on whether IPv4 or IPv6 address is
   encoded in the Endpoint field.

   Color: SR Policy color value, non-zero as per [RFC9256] Section 2.1.

   Endpoint: can be either IPv4 or IPv6.  This value MAY be different
   from the one contained in the Destination address field in the END-
   POINTS object, or in the Tunnel Endpoint Address field in the LSP-
   IDENTIFIERS TLV.

   If the PCEP speaker receives an SRPA object whose Association
   Parameters do not follow the above specification, then the PCEP
   speaker MUST send a PCErr message with Error-Type = 26 "Association
   Error", Error-Value = 20 "SR Policy Identifier Mismatch".

   The purpose of choosing the Association Parameters in this way is to
   guarantee that there is no possibility of a race condition when
   multiple PCEP speakers want to associate the same SR Policy at the
   same time.  By adhering to this format, all PCEP speakers come up
   with the same Association Parameters independently of each other
   based on the SR Policy [RFC9256] parameters.  Thus, there is no
   chance that different PCEP speakers will come up with different
   Association Parameters for the same SR Policy.

   The last hop of the computed SR Policy Candidate Path MAY differ from
   the Endpoint contained in the <headend, color, endpoint> tuple.  An
   example use case is to terminate the SR Policy before reaching the
   Endpoint and have decapsulated traffic go the rest of the way to the
   Endpoint node using the native IGP path(s).  In this example, the
   destination of the SR Policy Candidate Paths will be some node before
   the Endpoint, but the Endpoint value is still used at the head-end to
   steer traffic with that Endpoint IP into the SR Policy.  The
   Destination of the SR Policy Candidate Path is signaled using the
   END-POINTS object and/or LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV, as per the usual PCEP
   procedures.  When neither the END-POINTS object nor LSP-IDENTIFIERS
   TLV is present, the PCEP speaker MUST extract the destination from
   the Endpoint field in the SRPA Extended Association ID TLV.

   SR Policy with Color-Only steering is signaled with the End-Point
   value set to null, i.e., 0.0.0.0 for IPv4 or :: for IPv6, see
   [RFC9256] Section 8.8.1.

4.2.  Association Information

   The SRPA object may carry the following TLVs:

   *  SRPOLICY-POL-NAME TLV: (optional) encodes SR Policy Name string.

   *  SRPOLICY-CPATH-ID TLV: (mandatory) encodes SR Policy Candidate
      Path Identifier.

   *  SRPOLICY-CPATH-NAME TLV: (optional) encodes SR Policy Candidate
      Path string name.

   *  SRPOLICY-CPATH-PREFERENCE TLV: (optional) encodes SR Policy
      Candidate Path preference value.

   Out of these TLVs, the SRPOLICY-CPATH-ID TLV is mandatory, all others
   are optional.  When a mandatory TLV is missing from the SRPA object,
   the PCEP speaker MUST send a PCErr message with Error-Type = 6
   "Mandatory Object Missing", Error-Value = 21 "Missing SR Policy
   Mandatory TLV".

   This document specifies four new TLVs to be carried in the SRPA
   object.  Only one TLV instance of each type can be carried, and only
   the first occurrence is processed.  Any others MUST be ignored.

4.2.1.  SR Policy Name TLV

   The SRPOLICY-POL-NAME TLV is an optional TLV for the SRPA object.

   Protocol Origin: 8-bit value that encodes the protocol origin, as
   specified in Section 6.5.  Note that in the PCInitiate message
   [RFC8281], the Protocol Origin is always set to 10 - "PCEP (In PCEP
   or when BGP-LS Producer is PCE)".  The "SR Policy Protocol Origin"
   IANA registry includes a combination of values intended for use in
   PCEP and BGP-LS.  When the registry contains two variants of values
   associated with the mechanism or protocol used for provisioning of
   the Candidate Path, for example 1 - "PCEP" and 10 - "PCEP (In PCEP or
   when BGP-LS Producer is PCE)", the "(In PCEP or when BGP-LS Producer
   is PCE)" variants MUST be used in PCEP.

   Reserved: This field MUST be set to zero on transmission and MUST be
   ignored on receipt.

   Originator ASN: Represented as a 4-byte number, part of the
   originator identifier, as specified in Section 2.4 of [RFC9256].
   When sending a PCInitiate message [RFC8281], the PCE is the
   originator of the Candidate Path.  AS number is not a PCE concept and
   PCE is not required to have one for itself.  If the PCE has its AS
   number, then it MUST set it, otherwise the AS number can be set to 0.

   Originator Address: Represented as a 128-bit value as specified in
   Section 2.4 of [RFC9256].  When sending a PCInitiate message, the PCE
   is acting as the originator and therefore MUST set this to an address
   that it owns.

   Discriminator: 32-bit value that encodes the Discriminator of the
   Candidate Path, as specified in [RFC9256] Section 2.5.  This is the
   field that mainly distinguishes different SR Candidate Paths, coming
   from the same originator.  It is allowed to be any number in the
   32-bit range.

4.2.3.  SR Policy Candidate Path Name TLV

   The SRPOLICY-CPATH-NAME TLV is an optional TLV for the SRPA object.

5.  Other Mechanisms

   This section describes mechanisms that are standardized for SR
   Policies in [RFC9256], but do not make use of the SRPA for signaling
   in PCEP.  Since SRPA is not used, there needs to be a separate
   capability negotiation.

   This document specifies four new TLVs to be carried in the OPEN or
   LSP object.  Only one TLV instance of each type can be carried, and
   only the first occurrence is processed.  Any others MUST be ignored.

5.1.  SR Policy Capability TLV

   The SRPOLICY-CAPABILITY TLV is a TLV for the OPEN object.  It is used
   at session establishment to learn the peer's capabilities with
   respect to SR Policy.  Implementations that support SR Policy MUST
   include SRPOLICY-CAPABILITY TLV in the OPEN object.  In addition, the
   ASSOC-Type-List TLV containing SRPA Type (6) MUST be present in the
   OPEN object, as specified in Section 4.

   If a PCEP speaker receives SRPA but the SRPOLICY-CAPABILITY TLV is
   not exchanged, then the PCEP speaker MUST send a PCErr message with
   Error- Type = 10 ("Reception of an invalid object") and Error-Value =
   TBD ("Missing SRPOLICY-CAPABILITY TLV") and MUST then close the PCEP
   session.

   flag is not set, then the PCEP speaker MUST NOT send the COMPUTATION-
   PRIORITY TLV and MUST ignore it on receipt.

   E-Flag (Explicit NULL Label Policy): If set to '1' by a PCEP speaker,
   the E flag indicates that the PCEP speaker supports the handling of
   ENLP TLV for the SR Policy, see Section 5.3.  If this flag is not
   set, then the PCEP speaker MUST NOT send the ENLP TLV and MUST ignore
   it on receipt.

   I-Flag (Invalidation): If set to '1' by a PCEP speaker, the I flag
   indicates that the PCEP speaker supports the handling of INVALIDATION
   TLV for the SR Policy, see Section 5.4.  If this flag is not set,
   then the PCEP speaker MUST NOT send the INVALIDATION TLV and MUST
   ignore it on receipt.

   not set this flag then the PCC MUST NOT send PCReq messages to this
   PCE for the SR Policy.

   Unassigned bits MUST be set to '0' on transmission and MUST be

5.2.  Computation Priority TLV

   The COMPUTATION-PRIORITY TLV is an optional TLV for the LSP object.
   It is used to signal the numerical computation priority, as specified
   in Section 2.12 of [RFC9256].  If the TLV is absent from the LSP
   object and the P-flag in the SRPOLICY-CAPABILITY TLV is set to 1, a
   default Priority value of 128 is used.

   Reserved: This field MUST be set to zero on transmission and MUST be
   ignored on receipt.

5.3.  Explicit Null Label Policy (ENLP) TLV

   To steer an unlabeled IP packet into an SR policy, it is necessary to
   create a label stack for that packet, and push one or more labels
   onto that stack.  The Explicit NULL Label Policy (ENLP) TLV is an
   optional TLV for the LSP object used to indicate whether an Explicit
   NULL Label [RFC3032] must be pushed on an unlabeled IP packet before
   any other labels.  The contents of this TLV are used by the SRPM as
   described in section 4.1 of [RFC9256].  If an ENLP TLV is not

   present, the decision of whether to push an Explicit NULL label on a
   given packet is a matter of local configuration.  Note that Explicit
   Null is currently only defined for SR MPLS and not for SRv6.
   Therefore the PCEP speaker MUST ignore the presence of this TLV for
   SRv6 Policies.

   Reserved: This field MUST be set to zero on transmission and MUST be
   ignored on receipt.

   The ENLP reserved values may be used for future extensions and
   implementations MUST ignore the ENLP TLV with these values.  The
   behavior signaled in this TLV MAY be overridden by local
   configuration.  Section 4.1 of [RFC9256] describes the behavior on
   the headend for the handling of the explicit null label.

5.4.  Invalidation TLV

   The INVALIDATION TLV is an optional TLV for the LSP object.  It is
   used to control traffic steering into the LSP when the LSP is
   operationally down/invalid.  In the context of SR Policy, this TLV
   facilitates the Drop-upon-invalid behavior, specified in Section 8.2
   of [RFC9256].  Normally, if the LSP is down/invalid then it stops
   attracting traffic and traffic that would have been destined for that
   LSP is redirected somewhere else, such as via IGP or another LSP.
   The Drop-upon-invalid behavior specifies that the LSP keeps
   attracting traffic and the traffic has to be dropped at the head-end.
   Such an LSP is said to be "in drop state".  While in the drop state,
   the LSP operational state is "UP", as indicated by the O-flag in the
   LSP object.  However, the ERO object MAY be empty, if no valid path

   The INVALIDATION TLV is used in both directions between PCEP peers:

   *  PCE -> PCC: PCE specifies to the PCC whether to enable or disable
      Drop-upon-invalid (Config).

   *  PCC -> PCE: PCC reports the current setting of the Drop-upon-

      state (Oper).

5.4.1.  Drop-upon-invalid applies to SR Policy

   The Drop-upon-invalid feature is somewhat special among the other SR
   Policy features in the way that it is enabled/disabled.  This feature
   is enabled only on the whole SR Policy, not on a particular Candidate
   Path of that SR Policy, i.e., when any Candidate Path has Drop-upon-
   invalid enabled, it means that the whole SR Policy has the feature
   enabled.  As stated in [RFC9256] Section 8.1, the SR Policy is
   invalid when all its Candidate Paths are invalid.

   Once all the Candidate Paths of the SR Policy have become invalid,
   then the SR Policy checks whether any of the Candidate Paths have
   Drop-upon-invalid enabled.  If so, SR Policy enters the drop state
   and "activates" the highest preference Candidate Path which has the
   Drop-upon-invalid enabled.  Note that only one Candidate Path needs
   to be reported to the PCE with the D (dropping) flag set.

5.5.  Update to RFC 8231

   [RFC8231] Section 5.8.2, allows delegation of an LSP in operationally
   down state, but at the same time mandates the use of PCReq before
   sending PCRpt.  This document updates [RFC8231] Section 5.8.2, by
   making this section not applicable to SR Policy LSPs.  Thus, when a
   PCC wants to delegate an SR Policy LSP, it MAY proceed directly to
   sending PCRpt, without first sending PCReq and waiting for PCRep.
   This has the advantage of reducing the number of PCEP messages and
   simplifying the implementation.

   Furthermore, a PCEP speaker is not required to support PCReq/PCRep at
   all for SR Policies.  The PCEP speaker can indicate support for
   PCReq/PCRep via the "L-Flag" in the SRPOLICY-CAPABILITY TLV (See
   Section 5.1).  When this flag is cleared, or when the SRPOLICY-

   CAPABILITY TLV is absent, the given peer MUST NOT be sent PCReq/PCRep
   messages for SR Policy LSPs.  Conversely, when this flag is set, the
   peer can receive and process PCReq/PCRep messages for SR Policy LSPs.

   The above applies only to SR Policy LSPs and does not affect other
   LSP types, such as RSVP-TE LSPs.  For other LSP types, [RFC8231]
   Section 5.8.2 continues to apply.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Association Type

   This document defines a new association type: SR Policy Association.
   IANA is requested to confirm the following allocation in the
   "ASSOCIATION Type Field" registry [RFC8697] within the "Path
   Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" registry group:

7.  Implementation Status

   [Note to the RFC Editor - remove this section before publication, as
   well as remove the reference to RFC 7942.]

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

8.  Security Considerations

   The information carried in the newly defined SRPA object and TLVs
   could provide an eavesdropper with additional information about the
   SR Policy.

   The security considerations described in [RFC5440], [RFC8231],
   [RFC8281], [RFC8664], [RFC8697], [RFC9256] and [RFC9603] are
   applicable to this specification.

   As per [RFC8231], it is RECOMMENDED that these PCEP extensions can
   only be activated on authenticated and encrypted sessions across PCEs
   and PCCs belonging to the same administrative authority, using
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC8253] as per the recommendations
   and best current practices in [RFC9325].

   [RFC5440], [RFC8231], [RFC8664], [RFC9256] and [RFC9603] apply to
   PCEP protocol extensions defined in this document.  In addition,
   requirements and considerations listed in this section apply.

9.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   A PCE or PCC implementation MAY allow the capabilities specified in
   Section 5.1 and the capability for support of SRPA advertised in
   ASSOC-Type-List TLV to be enabled and disabled.

9.2.  Information and Data Models

   The PCEP YANG module [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-yang] will be extended with
   PCEP extensions specified Section 5 of this document.
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-srv6-yang] defines YANG module with common
   building blocks for PCEP Extensions described in Section 4.

9.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   listed in [RFC5440], [RFC8664] and [RFC9256].

9.4.  Verify Correct Operations

   Operation verification requirements already listed in [RFC5440],
   [RFC8231], [RFC8664], [RFC9256] and [RFC9603] are applicable to
   mechanisms defined in this document.

   An implementation MUST allow the operator to view SR Policy
   Identifier and SR Policy Candidate Path Identifier advertised in SRPA
   object.

   An implementation SHOULD allow the operator to view the capabilities
   defined in this document.

   An implementation SHOULD allow the operator to view LSPs associated
   with specific SR Policy Identifier.

9.5.  Requirements On Other Protocols

   The PCEP extensions defined in this document do not imply any new
   requirements on other protocols.

9.6.  Impact On Network Operations

   The mechanisms defined in [RFC5440], [RFC8231], [RFC9256] and
   [RFC9603] also apply to the PCEP extensions defined in this document.
