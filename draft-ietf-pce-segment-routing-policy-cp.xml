<abstract>

<t>
   Segment Routing (SR) allows a node to steer a packet flow along any
   path. SR Policy is an ordered list of segments (i.e.,
   instructions) that represent a source-routed policy.  Packet flows
   are steered into an SR Policy on a node where it is instantiated
   called a headend node. An SR Policy is made of one or more candidate
   paths.
</t>

<t>
   This document specifies the Path Computation Element Communication
   Protocol (PCEP) extension to signal candidate paths of the SR
   Policy.
   Additionally, this document updates RFC 8231 to allow
   stateful bring up of an SR Label Switched Path (LSP), without using
   the path computation request and reply messages.
   This document is applicable to both Segment Routing over MPLS (SR-MPLS) and
   Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6).

<section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>Segment Routing Policy Architecture <xref target="RFC9256"/> details the concepts of SR Policy and approaches to steering traffic into an SR Policy.</t>

<t>PCEP Extensions for Segment Routing <xref target="RFC8664"/> specifies extensions to the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) that allow a stateful PCE to compute and initiate Traffic Engineering (TE) paths, as well as a PCC to request a path subject to certain constraint(s) and optimization criteria in SR networks.
Although PCEP extensions introduced in <xref target="RFC8664"/> were originally used to create SR-TE tunnels, these are not SR Policies and lack many important features and details.
</t>

<t>PCEP Extensions for Establishing Relationships Between Sets of PCEP LSPs <xref target="RFC8697"/> introduces a generic mechanism to create a grouping of LSPs which is called an Association.</t>

<t>
This document extends <xref target="RFC8664"/> to support signaling SR Policy Candidate Paths as PCEP LSPs and to signal Candidate Path membership in
an SR Policy by means of the Association mechanism.
The PCEP Association corresponds to the SR Policy and the PCEP LSP corresponds to the Candidate Path.
The unit of signaling in PCEP is the LSP, thus all the information is carried at the Candidate Path level.
</t>

<t>This document updates Section 5.8.2 of <xref target="RFC8231"/>, making the PCReq message optional for LSPs set up using Path Setup Type 1 (Segment Routing) described in <xref target="RFC8664"/> and 3 (SRv6) described in <xref target="RFC9603"/>, allowing a PCC to delegate such LSP by sending a PCRpt without the preliminary PCReq and PCRep messages, with the aim of reducing the PCEP message exchanges and simplifying implementation.</t>

<t>
The SR Policy is represented by a new type of PCEP Association, called the SR Policy Association.
The SR Candidate Paths of an SR Policy are the PCEP LSPs within the same SRPA.
The subject of encoding multiple Segment Lists within an SR Policy Candidate Path is described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-multipath"/>.
</t>

<t>The SRPA carries three pieces of information:
SR Policy Identifier, SR Policy Candidate Path Identifier, and SR Policy Candidate Path Attribute(s).</t>

<t>
This document also specifies some additional information that is not encoded as part of SRPA: Computation Priority, Explicit Null Label Policy and Drop-upon-invalid behavior.
</t>

<t>
This document does not propose any extension for the use of BSID with SR Policy; the existing behavior is documented in <xref target="RFC9604"/>.
</t>

<section anchor="SRPolicyIdentifier" title="SR Policy Identifier">
<t>SR Policy Identifier uniquely identifies the SR Policy <xref target="RFC9256"/> within the network.
SR Policy Identifier MUST be the same for all SR Policy Candidate Paths in the same SRPA.
SR Policy Identifier MUST be constant for a given SR Policy Candidate Path for the lifetime of the PCEP session.
SR Policy Identifier MUST be different for different SRPAs.
If the identifier is inconsistent among Candidate Paths, changes during the lifetime of the PCEP session, or is not unique across different SRPAs, the PCEP speaker MUST send a PCErr message with Error-Type = 26 "Association Error" and Error Value = 20 "SR Policy Identifier Mismatch".

</section> <!-- Overview -->

<section anchor="Association" title="SR Policy Association">
<t>
   As per <xref target="RFC8697"/>, LSPs are associated with other LSPs with which they
   interact by adding them to a common association group.  As described
   in <xref target="RFC8697"/>, the association group is uniquely identified by the
   combination of the following fields in the ASSOCIATION object:
   Association Type, Association ID, Association Source, and (if
   present) Global Association Source or Extended Association ID,
   referred to as Association Parameters.
</t>
<t>
<xref target="RFC8697"/> specifies the ASSOCIATION Object with two Object-Types for IPv4 and IPv6 which includes the field "Association Type". This document defines a new Association type (6) "SR Policy Association" for SRPA.
</t>

<t>
<xref target="RFC8697"/> specifies the mechanism for the capability advertisement of
   the Association Types supported by a PCEP speaker by defining an
   ASSOC-Type-List TLV to be carried within an OPEN object. This
   capability exchange for the SR Policy Association Types MUST
   be done before using the SRPA.  Thus, the
   PCEP speaker MUST include the SRPA Type (6) in
   the ASSOC-Type-List TLV and MUST receive the same from the PCEP peer
   before using SRPA.
</t>

<t>
A given LSP MUST belong to at most one SRPA, since an SR Policy Candidate Path cannot belong to multiple SR Policies.
If a PCEP speaker receives a PCEP message requesting to join more than one SRPA for the same LSP,
then the PCEP speaker MUST send a PCErr message with
Error-Type = 26 "Association Error", Error-Value = 7 "Cannot join the association group".
</t>

<section anchor="AssociationParameters" title="Association Parameters">

<t>
As per <xref target="RFC9256"/>,
an SR Policy is identified through the tuple &#60;headend, color, endpoint&#62;.
The headend is encoded in the 'Association Source' field in the ASSOCIATION object.
The color and endpoint are encoded as part of the Extended Association ID TLV.
</t>

<t>The Association Parameters (see <xref target="Terminology"/>) consist of:</t>
<t>
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Association Type: Part of the base ASSOCIATION object. Set to 6 "SR Policy Association".</t>
        <t>Association Source (IPv4/IPv6): Part of the base ASSOCIATION object. Set to the headend value of the SR Policy, as defined in <xref target="RFC9256"/> Section 2.1.</t>
        <t>Association ID (16-bit): Part of the base ASSOCIATION object. Always set to the numeric value "1". This 16-bit field does not store meaningful data, because neither the Color nor the Endpoint can fit in it.</t>
	<t>Extended Association ID TLV: Mandatory TLV of the ASSOCIATION object. Encodes the Color and Endpoint of the SR Policy.</t>
      </list>
</t>

<t>Type: Extended Association ID TLV, type = 31 <xref target="RFC8697"/>.</t>

<t>Length: Either 8 or 20, depending on whether IPv4 or IPv6 address is encoded in the Endpoint field.</t>

<t>Color: SR Policy color value, non-zero as per <xref target="RFC9256"/> Section 2.1.</t>

<t>Endpoint: can be either IPv4 or IPv6.
This value MAY be different from the one contained in the Destination address field in the END-POINTS object, or in the Tunnel Endpoint Address field in the LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV.</t>

<t>If the PCEP speaker receives an SRPA object
whose Association Parameters do not follow the above specification,
then the PCEP speaker MUST send a PCErr message with
Error-Type = 26 "Association Error", Error-Value = 20 "SR Policy Identifier Mismatch".</t>

<t>The purpose of choosing the Association Parameters in this way is to guarantee that there is no possibility of a race condition when multiple PCEP speakers want to associate the same SR Policy at the same time. By adhering to this format, all PCEP speakers come up with the same Association Parameters independently of each other based on the SR Policy <xref target="RFC9256"/> parameters. Thus, there is no chance that different PCEP speakers will come up with different Association Parameters for the same SR Policy.</t>

<t>
The last hop of the computed SR Policy Candidate Path MAY differ from the Endpoint contained in the &#60;headend, color, endpoint&#62; tuple.
An example use case is to terminate the SR Policy before reaching the Endpoint and have decapsulated traffic go the rest of the way to the Endpoint node using the native IGP path(s).
In this example, the destination of the SR Policy Candidate Paths will be some node before the Endpoint, but the Endpoint value is still used at the head-end to steer traffic with that Endpoint IP into the SR Policy.
The Destination of the SR Policy Candidate Path is signaled using the END-POINTS object and/or LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV, as per the usual PCEP procedures.
When neither the END-POINTS object nor LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV is present,
the PCEP speaker MUST extract the destination from the Endpoint field in the SRPA Extended Association ID TLV.
</t>

<t>
SR Policy with Color-Only steering is signaled with the End-Point value set to null, i.e., 0.0.0.0 for IPv4 or :: for IPv6, see <xref target="RFC9256"/> Section 8.8.1.

<t>Protocol Origin: 8-bit value that encodes the protocol origin, as specified in <xref target="protocol_origin"/>.
Note that in the PCInitiate message <xref target="RFC8281"/>, the Protocol Origin is always set to 10 - "PCEP (In PCEP or when BGP-LS Producer is PCE)". The "SR Policy Protocol Origin" IANA registry includes a combination of values intended for use in PCEP and BGP-LS. When the registry contains two variants of values associated with the mechanism or protocol used for provisioning of the Candidate Path, for example 1 - "PCEP" and 10 - "PCEP (In PCEP or when BGP-LS Producer is PCE)", the "(In PCEP or when BGP-LS Producer is PCE)" variants MUST be used in PCEP.</t>

<t>Reserved: This field MUST be set to zero on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.</t>

<t>Originator ASN: Represented as a 4-byte number, part of the originator identifier, as specified in <xref format="default" section="2.4" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9256"/>.
When sending a PCInitiate message <xref target="RFC8281"/>, the PCE is the originator of the Candidate Path.
AS number is not a PCE concept and PCE is not required to have one for itself.
If the PCE has its AS number, then it MUST set it, otherwise the AS number can be set to 0.
</t>

<t>Originator Address: Represented as a 128-bit value as specified in <xref format="default" section="2.4" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9256"/>. When sending a PCInitiate message, the PCE is acting as the originator and therefore MUST set this to an address that it owns.
</t>

<t>Discriminator: 32-bit value that encodes the Discriminator of the Candidate Path, as specified in <xref target="RFC9256"/> Section 2.5.
This is the field that mainly distinguishes different SR Candidate Paths, coming from the same originator. It is allowed to be any number in the 32-bit range.

<t>
    To steer an unlabeled IP packet into an SR policy, it is necessary to create a label stack for that packet, and push one or more labels onto that stack.
    The Explicit NULL Label Policy (ENLP) TLV is an optional TLV for the LSP object used to indicate whether an Explicit NULL Label <xref target="RFC3032"/> must be pushed on an unlabeled IP packet before any other labels.
    The contents of this TLV are used by the SRPM as described in section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC9256"/>.
    If an ENLP TLV is not present, the decision of whether to push an Explicit NULL label on a given packet is a matter of local configuration.
Note that Explicit Null is currently only defined for SR MPLS and not for SRv6. Therefore the PCEP speaker MUST ignore the presence of this TLV for SRv6 Policies.

<section anchor="Invalidation-tlv" title="Invalidation TLV">

<t>The INVALIDATION TLV is an optional TLV for the LSP object.
It is used to control traffic steering into the LSP
when the LSP is operationally down/invalid.
In the context of SR Policy, this TLV facilitates
the Drop-upon-invalid behavior,
specified in Section 8.2 of <xref target="RFC9256"/>.
Normally, if the LSP is down/invalid then it stops attracting traffic and
traffic that would have been destined for that LSP
is redirected somewhere else, such as via IGP or another LSP.
The Drop-upon-invalid behavior specifies that the LSP keeps attracting traffic
and the traffic has to be dropped at the head-end.
Such an LSP is said to be "in drop state".
While in the drop state, the LSP operational state is "UP",
as indicated by the O-flag in the LSP object.
However, the ERO object MAY be empty, if no valid path has been computed.
</t>
<t>
The INVALIDATION TLV is used in both directions between PCEP peers:
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>PCE -> PCC: PCE specifies to the PCC whether to enable or disable Drop-upon-invalid (Config).</t>

<section anchor="Invalidation-per-policy" title="Drop-upon-invalid applies to SR Policy">

<t>
The Drop-upon-invalid feature is somewhat special among the other SR Policy features in the way that it is enabled/disabled.
This feature is enabled only on the whole SR Policy, not on a particular Candidate Path of that SR Policy,
i.e., when any Candidate Path has Drop-upon-invalid enabled, it means that the whole SR Policy has the feature enabled.
As stated in <xref target="RFC9256"/> Section 8.1, the SR Policy is invalid when all its Candidate Paths are invalid.
</t>

<t>
Once all the Candidate Paths of the SR Policy have become invalid, then the SR Policy checks whether any of the Candidate Paths
have Drop-upon-invalid enabled.
If so, SR Policy enters the drop state and "activates" the highest preference Candidate Path which has
the Drop-upon-invalid enabled.
Note that only one Candidate Path needs to be reported to the PCE with the D (dropping) flag set.

<section anchor="Stateless-oper" title="Update to RFC 8231">

<t>
<xref target="RFC8231"/> Section 5.8.2, allows delegation of an LSP in operationally down state,
but at the same time mandates the use of PCReq before sending PCRpt.
This document updates <xref target="RFC8231"/> Section 5.8.2,
by making this section not applicable to SR Policy LSPs.
Thus, when a PCC wants to delegate an SR Policy LSP, it MAY proceed directly to sending PCRpt,
without first sending PCReq and waiting for PCRep.
This has the advantage of reducing the number of PCEP messages and simplifying the implementation.
</t>

<t>
Furthermore, a PCEP speaker is not required to support PCReq/PCRep at all for SR Policies.
The PCEP speaker can indicate support for PCReq/PCRep via the "L-Flag" in
the SRPOLICY-CAPABILITY TLV (See <xref target="Capability-tlv"/>).
When this flag is cleared, or when the SRPOLICY-CAPABILITY TLV is absent,
the given peer MUST NOT be sent PCReq/PCRep messages for SR Policy LSPs.
Conversely, when this flag is set, the peer can receive and process
PCReq/PCRep messages for SR Policy LSPs.
</t>

<t>
The above applies only to SR Policy LSPs and does not affect other LSP types,
such as RSVP-TE LSPs. For other LSP types, <xref target="RFC8231"/> Section 5.8.2
continues to apply.

<section  title="Implementation Status">
      <t>[Note to the RFC Editor - remove this section before publication, as
      well as remove the reference to RFC 7942.]</t>

      <t>This section records the status of known implementations of the
      protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
      Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in <xref
      target="RFC7942"/>. The description of implementations in this section
      is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing
      drafts to RFCs. Please note that the listing of any individual
      implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF. Furthermore,
      no effort has been spent to verify the information presented here that
      was supplied by IETF contributors. This is not intended as, and must not
      be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
      features. Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
      exist.</t>


      <t>According to <xref target="RFC7942"/>, "this will allow reviewers and
      working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the
      benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable
      experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols
      more mature. It is up to the individual working groups to use this
      information as they see fit".</t>
